# IBM Slack bot
![imb logo](https://i.ya-webdesign.com/images/ibm-logo-white-png-18.png)
This repository contains a project for a bot in the IBM **Slack** forum. The bot will have a number of functions and features listed below.

## Requirements
The bot should be able to handle following events
	
- [x] Send a welcome-message, about the bot and other useful information, to a new member joining slack.
- [x]  Listens and responds to commands integrated in slack eg /info, /weather etc.
- [ ] Integrates with IBM calendar (is it possible..?)

***
The project is intended to be developed in javascript in general and nodejs in particular and the application will use an express server with a developed REST API in the backend that receives and handles requests sent by slack api.


## Hosting options
How should the application be hosted? There may be different options for how to host it, but we need to explore different aspects for what is best. For example, can we host it on an existing cloud-based service at IBM and what are the risks with that option? Or is this something we will need to host "ourselves" in the office? For example buy a raspberry pi and host it on our own wifi.
